# Security Policy

## Version information

Include the installed version or source commit in your report. The [latest release](https://github.com/Swarneil1905/LocalMind/releases/latest) identifies the current published version; `main` may contain changes that have not shipped. If you reproduced the issue on multiple versions, list them separately.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not file a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Report security issues by emailing **swarneil1905@gmail.com** with the subject line:

```
[LocalMind Security] <brief description>
```

Include:

- A description of the vulnerability and its potential impact
- Steps to reproduce or a proof-of-concept (if available)
- Any suggested mitigations you have identified

### Response SLA

| Stage | Target |
|-------|--------|
| Initial acknowledgement | 48 hours |
| Triage and severity assessment | 5 business days |
| Fix or mitigation released | 30 days for critical/high, 90 days for medium/low |
| Public disclosure | Coordinated with reporter after fix is available |

## Security Model

Local chat inference runs on the user's computer through Ollama. Optional features have separate network and credential requirements:

- **No built-in analytics or usage tracking.** Local chat does not require a LocalMind account. Optional connected services can require their own accounts.
- **Network use.** Web queries and retrieved pages, authorized connectors, reviewed Runway video requests, optional cloud chat requests to OpenAI, Anthropic and Gemini, reviewed OpenAI image generation requests, model/runtime downloads and GitHub update checks can use the network. See the [data destinations](README.md#your-data) and [feature limitations](README.md#optional-and-experimental-features).
- **Credentials and stored data.** Gmail, Runway and optional cloud chat provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini) credentials use the native OS credential store with no plaintext fallback. Credentials are used to authenticate to their providers. Ordinary profile databases are not encrypted by LocalMind and rely on OS account permissions. Cloud chat and image requests transmit only user-approved, already-reviewed content or prompts to the official provider endpoints; API keys remain on the device except as authentication headers.
- **Sidecar authentication.** The Python sidecar listens on loopback and uses a per-session bearer token generated at startup. The token is never written to disk. This is a local desktop boundary, not a hosted multi-user authentication system.
- **Web fetching.** The fetcher checks destination addresses and redirect hops, rejecting private, loopback and link-local addresses. Report bypasses privately.
- **Untrusted context.** Web content is filtered and supplied as reference data. These measures do not guarantee protection against prompt injection. Action approval and scope checks must remain enforced outside model-generated text.

## Scope

The following are in scope for security reports:

- Remote code execution via the Tauri app or sidecar
- Local privilege escalation
- Data exfiltration (e.g., memory or knowledge files sent to a remote host)
- SSRF bypasses in the web fetcher
- Prompt injection that causes the model to exfiltrate local data
- Authentication bypass for the sidecar API

The following are **out of scope**:

- Vulnerabilities in Ollama itself (report to the [Ollama project](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/security))
- Vulnerabilities in third-party npm/Python packages not introduced by LocalMind code
- Social engineering attacks
- Denial-of-service against local resources (CPU/RAM exhaustion by a large model)
